    "text": "ABOUT ME\n\n\nThe Origin Story\nMy journey into the digital realm began at a young age, where I discovered the magic of video games. What started as button-mashing on my first console quickly evolved into a deep fascination with the technology behind the screens. I wasn’t just playing games—I was wondering how they were made, how the graphics rendered so smoothly, and how online multiplayer could connect players from across the world.\nThis curiosity sparked a passion for technology that would shape my entire future. After completing secondary school, I knew exactly where I wanted to go—Nanyang Polytechnic, where I pursued a diploma in Infocomm Technology. Those three years were transformative, diving deep into programming, networking, and software development. It was there that I truly leveled up my technical skills and confirmed that tech was my calling.\nBut the quest didn’t end there. Hungry for more knowledge and driven to specialize, I enrolled at the Singapore Institute of Technology to pursue a degree in Fintech. Now I’m combining my love for technology with the exciting world of finance, learning about blockchain, digital payments, and the future of financial services. It’s like unlocking a new game mode—challenging, rewarding, and full of possibilities.\nWhen I’m not grinding through assignments or exploring new technologies, you’ll still find me gaming. Some things never change—it’s where I recharge, connect with friends, and remind myself why I fell in love with tech in the first place.\n\n\n\n📷 YOUR PHOTO HERE 400 x 400px"
