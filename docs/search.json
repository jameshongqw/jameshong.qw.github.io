What started as button-mashing on my first console quickly evolved into a deep fascination with the technology behind the screens. I wasn’t just playing games—I was wondering how they were made, how the graphics rendered so smoothly, and how online multiplayer could connect players from across the world.\n\n\nThis curiosity sparked a passion for technology that would shape my entire future. After completing secondary school, I knew exactly where I wanted to go—Nanyang Polytechnic, where I pursued a diploma in Infocomm Technology. Those three years were transformative, diving deep into programming, networking, and software development. It was there that I truly leveled up my technical skills and confirmed that tech was my calling.\n\n\nBut the quest didn’t end there. Hungry for more knowledge and driven to specialize, I enrolled at the Singapore Institute of Technology to pursue a degree in Fintech. Now I’m combining my love for technology with the exciting world of finance, learning about blockchain, digital payments, and the future of financial services. It’s like unlocking a new game mode—challenging, rewarding, and full of possibilities.\n\n\nWhen I’m not grinding through assignments or exploring new technologies, you’ll still find me gaming. Some things never change—it’s where I recharge, connect with friends, and remind myself why I fell in love with tech in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n📷 YOUR PHOTO HERE 400 x 400px\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTER STATS\n\n\n\n\n🎮\n\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95/100\n\n\n\n\n💻\n\n\n\nCoding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80/100\n\n\n\n\n☕\n\n\n\nCoffee Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAX\n\n\n\n\n😴\n\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30/100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAVORITE GAMES\n\n\n\n\n🎮 GAME IMAGE 1 300 x 200px\n\n\n\nGame Title Here\n\n\nRPG / Adventure\n\n\n\n\n\n🎮 GAME IMAGE 2 300 x 200px\n\n\n\nGame Title Here\n\n\nFPS / Competitive\n\n\n\n\n\n🎮 GAME IMAGE 3 300 x 200px\n\n\n\nGame Title Here\n\n\nStrategy / MOBA\n\n\n\n\n\n🎮 GAME IMAGE 4 300 x 200px\n\n\n\nGame Title Here\n\n\nOpen World / Sandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\n\n\n▶ EMBED YOUR VIDEO HERE YouTube / Twitch Embed Replace with iframe embed code\n\n\n\n\nEpic Moments Compilation\n\n\nWatch my greatest gaming achievements, clutch plays, and unforgettable moments from various games.
