    "text": "ABOUT ME\n\n\nThe Origin Story\nMy journey into the digital realm began at a young age, where I discovered the magic of video games. What started as button-mashing on my first console quickly evolved into a deep fascination with the technology behind the screens. I wasn’t just playing games—I was wondering how they were made, how the graphics rendered so smoothly, and how online multiplayer could connect players from across the world.\nThis curiosity sparked a passion for technology that would shape my entire future. After completing secondary school, I knew exactly where I wanted to go—Nanyang Polytechnic, where I pursued a diploma in Infocomm Technology. Those three years were transformative, diving deep into programming, networking, and software development. It was there that I truly leveled up my technical skills and confirmed that tech was my calling.\nBut the quest didn’t end there. Hungry for more knowledge and driven to specialize, I enrolled at the Singapore Institute of Technology to pursue a degree in Fintech. Now I’m combining my love for technology with the exciting world of finance, learning about blockchain, digital payments, and the future of financial services. It’s like unlocking a new game mode—challenging, rewarding, and full of possibilities.\nWhen I’m not grinding through assignments or exploring new technologies, you’ll still find me gaming. Some things never change—it’s where I recharge, connect with friends, and remind myself why I fell in love with tech in the first place.\n\n\n\n📷 YOUR PHOTO HERE 400 x 400px"

    "text": "THE PROBLEM\n\nFinancial literacy among young adults in Singapore remains a significant challenge. Many youths find traditional insurance and financial planning intimidating, confusing, or simply boring. They often delay important financial decisions until it’s too late, missing out on the benefits of early financial planning.\nResearch shows that young adults are more likely to engage with content through social platforms. This insight became the foundation for FinYouth—why not meet them where they already are?"

    "text": "THE STORY BEHIND THIS\n\n\nMy Introduction to Crypto\nMy fascination with cryptocurrency began during my polytechnic years when Bitcoin first started making headlines. As someone passionate about technology, the concept of decentralized digital currency built on blockchain technology immediately captured my interest. It wasn’t just about the potential financial gains—it was about witnessing a technological revolution unfold in real-time.\n\n\nWhy Bitcoin Matters to Me\nBitcoin represents more than just a digital asset. It’s a paradigm shift in how we think about money, trust, and financial systems. As a Fintech student at SIT, understanding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology isn’t just a hobby—it’s essential knowledge for my future career. The intersection of finance and technology is exactly where I want to be.\n\n\n\nI’ve spent countless hours analyzing charts, understanding market cycles, and learning about the technology behind various cryptocurrencies. This visualization represents that journey—a visual representation of an asset class that has taught me about markets, volatility, risk management, and the importance of doing your own research."

    "text": "VISUALIZATION RATIONALE\n\n\nWhy Candlestick Charts?\nCandlestick charts were chosen over simple line charts because they convey four data points per time period instead of just one. This provides a much richer understanding of price action, showing not just where the price ended, but the entire journey it took to get there. The visual pattern recognition possible with candlesticks is invaluable for understanding market behavior.\n\n\nWhy Include Volume?\nVolume is the heartbeat of the market. Price movements accompanied by high volume are more significant than those with low volume. Including volume data adds another dimension to the analysis, helping distinguish between meaningful price movements and noise.\n\n\nWhy Dark Theme?\nBeyond aesthetic preference, the dark theme reduces eye strain during extended chart analysis sessions. Most professional traders prefer dark interfaces, and it aligns with the overall gaming-inspired theme of this portfolio website.\n\n\nWhy Interactive?\nStatic images become outdated immediately. An interactive, real-time chart allows viewers to explore the data themselves—zooming into specific periods, changing timeframes, and examining exact values. This transforms passive viewing into active exploration."

It helped me especially in filling out text for the website, which reduced a lot of repetitive cognitive workload. The tool is beneficial because it makes drafting faster and more efficient, but it can also be challenging at times as it is still a new technology and may produce unintended results. Overall, I can see GenAI tools supporting my future studies or work by speeding up ideation, drafting, and other routine tasks so I can focus on higher-level thinking. No other thoughts to add."
