## PROJECT OVERVIEW {.section-title}

::: {.project-intro}

### FinYouth - Social Finance App for the Youth

For my Final Year Project at Nanyang Polytechnic, I developed **FinYouth**, an innovative social application designed to bridge the gap between young adults and financial literacy. The app combines social networking features with insurance and financial planning tools, making personal finance more accessible and engaging for the youth demographic.

## THE PROBLEM {.section-title}

::: {.content-block}

Financial literacy among young adults in Singapore remains a significant challenge. Many youths find traditional insurance and financial planning intimidating, confusing, or simply boring. They often delay important financial decisions until it's too late, missing out on the benefits of early financial planning.

Research shows that young adults are more likely to engage with content through social platforms. This insight became the foundation for FinYouth—why not meet them where they already are?

## KEY LEARNINGS {.section-title}

::: {.content-block}

This project taught me invaluable lessons beyond just coding. I learned to conduct user research, iterate based on feedback, and balance technical feasibility with user needs. Working on a full-stack application from concept to deployment gave me a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle.

Most importantly, I discovered my passion for creating technology that makes a real difference in people's lives. FinYouth wasn't just a graduation requirement—it was a glimpse into the kind of meaningful work I want to pursue in my career.
